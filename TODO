Multi-module algorithm separation list:
1. Make ctest contain all utils responsible for testing
2. Move all testing, which requires algorithms to separate package (atest?)
3. Move all implementations with algorithms to separate packages in algo directory
4. Add go.mod to all packages in algo directory
